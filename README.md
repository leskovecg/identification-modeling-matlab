# üß† Identification and System Modeling (MATLAB Projects)

This repository contains projects related to system identification and modeling, developed as part of the "Identification" module at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana.

## üîç Overview

### Lab 1: Non-Parametric Identification
- ETFE frequency analysis
- Impulse response from IFFT
- Noise model identification and analysis
- Estimation of error bounds on transfer function

### Lab 2: Parametric Identification
- Transfer function estimation using Least Squares
- Comparison with non-parametric models
- Model validation with real data

### Lab 3: Real Process Identification
- Static curve measurement of a lab plant
- Linear model identification around operating point
- Validation with real-time data
- Output: discrete & continuous models + error analysis

## üíª Tools
- MATLAB (no Simulink required unless real-time lab used)
- Signal processing, regression, frequency analysis
